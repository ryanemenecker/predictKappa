    """A PyTorch many-to-many bidirectional recurrent neural network

    A class containing the PyTorch implementation of a BRNN. The network consists
    of repeating LSTM units in the hidden layers that propogate sequence information
    in both the foward and reverse directions. A final fully connected layer
    aggregates the deepest hidden layers of both directions and produces the
    outputs.

    "Many-to-many" refers to the fact that the network will produce outputs 
    corresponding to every item of the input sequence. For example, an input 
    sequence of length 10 will produce 10 sequential outputs.

    Attributes
    ----------
    device : str
        String describing where the network is physically stored on the computer.
        Should be either 'cpu' or 'cuda' (GPU).
    hidden_size : int
        Size of hidden vectors in the network
    num_layers : int
        Number of hidden layers (for each direction) in the network
    num_classes : int
        Number of classes for the machine learning task. If it is a regression
        problem, `num_classes` should be 1. If it is a classification problem,
        it should be the number of classes.
    lstm : PyTorch LSTM object
        The bidirectional LSTM layer(s) of the recurrent neural network.
    fc : PyTorch Linear object  
        The fully connected linear layer of the recurrent neural network. Across 
        the length of the input sequence, this layer aggregates the output of the
        LSTM nodes from the deepest forward layer and deepest reverse layer and
        returns the output for that residue in the sequence.

    -------
    forward(x)
        Propogate input sequences through the network to produce outputs
